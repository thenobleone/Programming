# fuelEconomy.py
# Created By Jo Narvaez-Jensen

# This program takes two data files that contain car fuel economy numbers
#    (city mpg, hwy mpg), finds their averages, and determines the # of
#   inefficient cars based on either an mpg < 22 City and/or 27 Hwy.

# takes in the 4 data sets and prints them out
